# physical-objects-arrangements
This is about how we can use computer to arrange some objects in physics to do experiments 
The idea is that: we combine a pen and an eraser, then we get an pen-eraser. If we use computer to arrange some objects, and analyse the result, we can use computer to creat new things. Maybe, some of these new things can be useful.
For example: if we can store the following information into a computer:
1. There is a reflector that if a light flash on it, it can reflect all the light;
2. There is another type of reflectors that if a light flash on it, some of light can be reflected, some pass;
3. There are some things(Laser pumping energy) can make some special matter(Gain medium) staying in this way in which the number of electrons in high energy level is bigger than that of the ground state;
4. We know these pumping matter exist.

And if a computer can:
5. arrange these four parts;
6. give us the result of these arrangements;

Then we can analyse which arrangements can be useful.Then we can creat a LASER.

All the steps above are not very difficult for computer, depending on how many arrangements we want.

If all the thing above can be realized, we can make a big progress on physics.

Now the first thing we need to do is to store many objects and their properties.
